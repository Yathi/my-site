				        <h1>Android Rooted</h1>
                            <p>
                            
                            Recently I rooted my Galaxy S2, after lot of thought mind you. But it turns out that rooting is one of the simplest things you can do with your phone to get lot of control on it. There are complicated methods of rooting but there are some damn simple ones as well! I'll try to explain from the start so that those of you who are considering rooting will understand the process completely.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            
                            <strong>What is meant by Rooting and Android Phone?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Those of you with a computer background and who have used Linux will know what is a root user. In windows terms, root user is the administrator of the system who has the privileges to make any changes to the system. And this is exactly what Rooting does to an Android phone. It gives you Administrator privileges with which you can even change the system settings and remove stuff which were there by default in the phone. But be warned, "With great power,
                            comes great responsibility!". You have to be careful once you root the phone as now you have the power to mess up the whole device and even brick it. (Bricking means messing up with some critical stuff which makes your phone unbootable and it becomes similar to a brick which does nothing). If you do not know what you are doing, better don't do it. <em>Rooting also voids the warranty of your phone.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            *Slightly advanced stuff. Beginners can safely ignore* But not always, if you are lucky. Because if you had just rooted your phone and you did not change the recovery, then you can easily flash a stock ROM, which removes root and makes your phone almost new and your warranty will hold. Except for the kernel counter (Even this can be reset with a USB Jig).

                                    <li>You can <strong>remove all the bloatware</strong> which comes preinstalled with your phone which you cannot normally uninstall. For each application, make sure that removing it will not harm the system.</li>
                                        <li>You can use <a title="Wireless Tether" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=android.tether&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImFuZHJvaWQudGV0aGVyIl0." target="_blank">Wireless Tether</a>.</li>

Lots of stuff. Definite must have if you root
                                            your phone.</li>
                                                <li>There are many Free Apps for Android which display Ads for being free. Sometimes its unobtrusive but sometimes it really spoils the user experience. The solution: <a title="AdFree" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bigtincan.android.adfree&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">AdFree</a>. Its an <strong>App which blocks all the Ads</strong> at the system level and makes the free applications much more usable.</li>

If you like changing themes to make your phone feel different you should check out custom ROMS :). And there are some brilliant ROMs, some based on AOSP* Android like Cyanogenmod (My fav), Miui, and many other ROMS.</li>
                                                        <li><strong>Custom Kernel: </strong>ROM can be thought of the part of Android the user actually interacts with, the User Interface and the Apps part. Kernel on the other hand is the base of the ROM which acts as the connect between the UI and the Hardware. So with a custom Kernel you can fine tune the hardware performance of your phone and even add new features(No UI changes). For example my Galaxy S2 does not have a notification LED.
                                                        But with a custom Kernel I can make the Backlight of the Menu and Back buttons blink when I get any notification.</li>

                            <h1>Task Killers for Android and why you should not use them!</h1>
                            <p>Recently I was talking to a friend who was complaining about his phone restarting often. And then he himself found out the problem which was the task killer in his phone. And I was surprised to hear that he even used Task Killers. On a Galaxy S2! What most ppl do not know is <strong>Task Killers are bad for Android!</strong></p>
                            <h3>How Android Works</h3>
                            <p>In Android, when you close an App it does not get closed completely. It stays in the memory and goes to the background but it does not use up any process or any resources unless its doing something at the background. So having an App in the memory is never a bad thing and the Android system is designed to have it like this so that the app can be restarted again whenever needed. When you do run low on memory, the system uses a smart algorithm based on how often
                            an App is used and when it was used the last time, to decide on which app to terminate to free up some RAM. And Android does it very well because it is designed to work best when most of the RAM is being used.  On Android, having your RAM nearly full is a good thing which most users do not understand. The main performance and battery issues are caused because of CPU bottleneck which no Task Killer Monitors.</p>
                        <h3>What Task Killers Do</h3>
                        <p>Task Killer convince you that the bad battery life and poor performance are because of the low free RAM on your Android phone. So they insist on closing as many Applications as possible. In Android having an application in memory takes up considerably less resources than having to stop and restart the application over and over again. And this is exactly what is done by task killers. Closing some background applications might even lead to instability and every time
                            an app has to restart it takes up a lot of CPU resource slowing down your phone.</p>
                        <h3>What You Should Do</h3>
                        <p>So do yourself a favor and uninstall the Task Killer from your phone. If you do have bloatware which you do not want running, I suggest rooting your phone. And use an application like Watchdog to monitor the CPU usage of all the apps. You really need not worry about the RAM on Android (at least not in IceCream Sandwitch and Higher).</p>
