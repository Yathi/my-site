                        <h1>A Guide to using a DSLR for Beginners: DSLR Terminology</h1>
                        <p>
                            First of all a <strong>DSLR</strong> stands for Digital Single Lens Reflex Camera. Digital explains itself. Single Lens Reflex means the image which is going to fall on the sensor(explained below) and the image which is visible through the optical viewfinder is coming from the same lens and you are actually seeing what is going to be captured. That is one of the most distinct characteristics of a DSLR and that is why you don't normally use the screen(called the live view) to
                            take an image. It might feel new to the beginners to take an image by looking through the viewfinder instead of the screen at the back but you will slowly get used to it. 
                       
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Live View:</strong>This is what is present in most compact cameras and all mobile phones. You see an electronic image of what is about to be captured at the screen on the back. Nowadays most DSLRs have this feature but this was absent in the ealier DSLRs because this is not actually how a DSLR is supposed to be used. Ofcouse you can use the Live View mode but the problem here is that the focus sensors don't work in live view. So you do not get the almost instant focus
                            you get through the viewfinder and instead the camera will slowly try to focus based on the image.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sensor:</strong>This is what converts the optical image into an electronic image and this is the most important reason why the quality of pictures from a dSLR seems distinctly better than a photo from a mobile camera or a compact cam. The larger the sensor the better will be the image quality and the noise will be less. Plus you get a better DOF(Depth of Field. Explained below). You can see the comparison of different sensor sizes in the image below:</p>

                        <p>A normal beginner DSLR has the APS-C sensor which is also called a crop sensor. Most professionals use Full Frame DSLRs but a Full Frame DSLR (Body Only) will set you back by more then a lakh (in Indian currency). Most of the current DSLRS which you would see your friends use are APS-C ones but even there you can see how much bigger the APS-C sensor is when compared to a compact camera. The sensor for a mobile phone camera is usually even smaller then that
                        of a compact.</p>
                        <p><strong>Exposure:</strong>Exposure in simple terms is the amount of light captured by the camera sensor when the shutter is open. It is measured in Exposure Value(EV) in most cameras. Exposure is what decides the brightness of an image. If the image is too bright with lot of white patches it is called Overexposed. And if the image is too dark where detail is lost in black areas then it is called Underexposed. Ideally the image should be correctly exposed and we should not depend on the
                        image on the LCD screen for this as it can be misleading. The correct tool to check exposure is a feature called <strong>Histogram</strong> which is present in all dSLRs but reading a histogram will be the topic of some later blog.</p>
                        <p>Now the exposure of an image is actually decided by 3 parameters. And on a dSLR, we can control all the 3 parameters to get the exact brightness level we want. The 3 parameters are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Shutter Speed: </strong>This setting determines the amount of time the shutter is open. The longer it is open the more light falls on the sensor. But at the same time, if the subject moves the image starts to look blurry. A faster shutter speed reduces the light falling on the sensor but it freezes motion. Usually for hand-holding the minimum recommended shutter speed even with Image Stabilization(in Canon) or VR(in Nikon) is around 1/40 of a sec. For sports it should be something
                                around 1/500 of a sec.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aperture: </strong>The light falling on the sensor of a camera goes through a circular hole whose diameter can be adjusted. Aperture rating tells about the diameter of this hole. This reading can be sometimes confusing the way it is expressed. An aperture of <strong>f1</strong> means that the aperture is fully open. This is the largest aperture value theoretically possible but no lens has it (to the best of my knowledge). You can nowadays get lenses
                                as wide as <strong>f1.2</strong> but they would be really
                                really costly! And on the other end the smallest aperture available on most lenses is <strong>f22</strong>. The advantage of a wide open aperture(like f1.2 or f1.4) is that it allows a lot of light to pass through. So your image would be more bright. Also a larger aperture means a shallower DOF(discussed below). At the same time a narrow aperture is needed when taking landscapes and all so that the whole picture is in focus. This point would be easier to understand
                                once you understand DOF.</li>
                            <li><strong>ISO: </strong>This could you considered as the sensitivity of the sensor. The higher the ISO the brighter will be the image. Very simple. But there is a drawback to increasing ISO. It increases the noise in the image making it look grainy (Though not as bad as the night shots from a mobile camera). So try to keep the minimum possible ISO for your preferred Aperture and Shutter speed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Kit Lens: </strong>This is typically the lens which comes with your camera. Usually in the lower end dSLRs(of both Nikon and Canon) this will be a <strong>18-55mm</strong> lens. And for starting it is a pretty good lens :). In some of the higher end APS-C Models your Kit lens might have a slightly longer focal range. For example in Nikon you can get the <strong>18-105mm</strong> Kit Lens and in Canon you can get the <strong>18-135mm</strong> kit lens. The top end kit lens for the APS-C models from both Canon and Nikon is the
                            <strong>18-200mm</strong> kit lens which can be used in almost all situation but usually disregarded by the professional photographers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Focus Points: </strong>These are the points spread across the sensor which will be sensitive to changes in contrast in the subject and adjust the focus. Most APS-C DSLR from both Canon and Nikon contain 9 or 11 focus points where the center is also usually a Cross Type focus point which are more sensitive than normal focus points. In all the dSLRs one can manually select which point we want the camera to focus on. </p>
                        <p><strong>Mode Dial: </strong>This is the most important dial in your camera and it decides in which mode the camera operates. This mode also decides what your control dial(The smaller dial near the shutter button) changes when you rotate it. The general Mode Dial of Canon and Nikon dSLRs is shown in the image below.</p>
                        <img src="http://s18.postimg.org/sab0xrle1/DSLRDummies2_Mode_Dials.png" alt="Mode Dials" class="center" />
                        <p>The Mode Dial as you see consists of two set of modes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Manual Modes: </strong>This includes <strong>Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Full Manual</strong>. In Canon Camera these are the four modes on the top side of the Green Square (Which is for Full Auto). In Nikons they are enclosed by a border as you can see. As you becomes a better dSLR user you would be only using these modes and you would never need the Auto or Scene modes. Infact most higher end dSLRs have only these Manual Modes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Automatic Scene Modes: </strong>These are the modes on the other side of the Full Auto and these are mostly present in the beginner dSLRs so that the users don't feel a shock when they switch to a dSLR from a compact. Personally I feel they only hinder the user from learning about the real modes and settings of a dSLR and they should not be used :).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now let's see the Manual Modes in a little more detail:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Program Mode: </strong>In this mode you set the ISO WB and other details. But the Shutter Speed and the Aperture is decided by your camera. This is the closest Manual Mode to Auto.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aperture Priority: </strong>In this mode we can set the aperture by rotating the dial. You can set the DOF by setting the aperture value. The camera adjust the shutter speed accordingly. This is the mode I use most of the time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shutter Priority: </strong>In this mode we decide the shutter speed and the camera adjust the Aperture accordingly. Usually used to take photos of high speed action sequences or if you want a very low shutter speed to capture light trails.</li>
                            <li><strong>Full Manual: </strong>In this mode we set both the aperture and the shutter speed. It is very easy to overexpose or underexpose and image when using Full Manual so keep an eye on the histogram as well as the exposure meter.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Drive Modes: </strong>The drive modes are the modes which decide what happen when you press the shutter button fully. The various drive modes which are present in almost all the cameras are: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Single Shot: Where just one photo is taken when you fully press the shutter even if u keep it held down. This is usually the default.</li>
                            <li>Continuous:  In continuous mode, the camera keeps taking photos repeatedly in succession as long as the shutter button is held down. You can use it to take a continuous series of shots when some action is taking place. If you are searching for a burst mode in your camera, this is it.</li>
                            <li>Timed Release: This is the timer shot. The camera takes the picture after a predefined time. Usually you can set it between 2 to 10 seconds.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>DOF: </strong>Depth of Field. This determines how much of the image is in focus. If we have a wide open Aperture( on the lines of f1.4 or f1.8) then we get a very shalow DOF. That means only the image which is being focused on will appear sharp. Everything infront of the focus and behind it will start to get blurry. The blurriness increases with distance from the subject. On the contrary if the aperture is closed down (on the lines of f18 or even more)
                            then we get a very large DOF where almost the whole frame is sharp. This is used to get landscape shots where the subject is much larger then the point we are focusing on.</p>
